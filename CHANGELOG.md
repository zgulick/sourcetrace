# SourceTrace Implementation Changelog

This document tracks deviations from the original Technical Specifications for transparency and future reference.

## Overview

The original technical specifications were created with certain technology assumptions that were later adjusted based on available resources and practical constraints for the 48-hour MVP timeline.

---

## Major Changes from Original Spec

### 1. LLM Provider Change

**Original Specification:**
- LLM: Anthropic Claude API
- Model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- Library: `anthropic==0.7.0`

**Updated Implementation:**
- LLM: OpenAI API
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
- Library: `openai==1.3.0`

**Reason:**
- Available OpenAI API key (no Claude API key accessible)
- OpenAI structured outputs (JSON mode) simplifies response parsing
- GPT-4o-mini is cost-effective and fast for MVP demonstration

**Impact:**
- All prompt templates converted from Claude format to OpenAI chat format (system + user messages)
- Added `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` for guaranteed JSON responses
- Temperature settings remain similar (0.3 for analysis, 0.5 for outreach)

---

### 2. Reverse Image Search Implementation

**Original Specification:**
- Service: TinEye API
- Cost: $200/year or 500 searches/month free tier
- Library: Direct API integration

**Updated Implementation:**
- Service: **TBD** - Options being evaluated:
  - SerpAPI (100 free searches/month)
  - Custom Google Images scraper
  - Bing Image Search API (free tier)
- Cost: Free tier only
- Decision: Will be finalized during Phase 2 implementation

**Reason:**
- TinEye cost ($200) exceeds budget for 48-hour prototype
- Free alternatives available with acceptable limitations
- Graceful degradation built in - system works even if search fails

**Impact:**
- Added risk management: reverse search may fail due to rate limits/CAPTCHAs
- LLM can still provide confidence scores based on EXIF + C2PA alone
- Requirements.txt does not include reverse search library until Phase 2
- UI will show "Reverse search unavailable" if service fails

---

### 3. Python Version Update

**Original Specification:**
- Python 3.9+

**Updated Implementation:**
- Python 3.10+

**Reason:**
- Best practice - Python 3.10 has better type hinting and performance
- Replit supports Python 3.10 well
- Better compatibility with modern libraries

**Impact:**
- Minimal - all libraries compatible with 3.10+
- Updated Replit configuration to use python-3.10 module

---

### 4. Additional Dependencies

**Original Specification:**
- Did not include `flask-cors`

**Updated Implementation:**
- Added `flask-cors==4.0.0`

**Reason:**
- Enables CORS for API endpoints
- Important for potential future frontend/backend separation
- Good practice for RESTful APIs

**Impact:**
- Better API architecture
- Enables testing with external tools
- No breaking changes

---

### 5. C2PA Implementation Documentation

**Original Specification:**
- "Optional: C2PA Python library (if available, otherwise mock)"
- Not explicitly stated as definitely mocked

**Updated Implementation:**
- **Explicitly mocked for MVP**
- Clear documentation that this demonstrates awareness
- Production implementation path documented

**Reason:**
- C2PA-python library integration would take significant time
- C2PA adoption is still emerging - "not found" is realistic for most UGC
- Demonstrates knowledge of cutting-edge provenance technology
- Within 48-hour timeline constraints

**Impact:**
- Always returns `{"present": false, "message": "..."}`
- Documented as interview differentiator
- Clear path to production implementation in README

---

### 6. OpenAI Model Selection

**Original Specification:**
- N/A (was Claude)

**Updated Implementation:**
- `gpt-4o-mini` as default model
- Configurable via environment variable `OPENAI_MODEL`

**Reason:**
- Cost-effective ($0.15/1M input tokens vs $3/1M for GPT-4)
- Fast response times (<2 seconds typically)
- Sufficient quality for provenance analysis
- Better for demonstration (no API cost concerns)

**Impact:**
- Faster analysis times
- Lower API costs
- Slightly less nuanced analysis than GPT-4 (acceptable for MVP)

---

## Environment Variable Changes

**Original `.env` structure:**
```env
CLAUDE_API_KEY=...
TINEYE_API_KEY=...
TINEYE_API_URL=...
```

**Updated `.env` structure:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
# SERPAPI_KEY=... (optional, TBD in Phase 2)
```

---

## Prompt Engineering Changes

**Original:**
- Single prompt string for Claude
- No explicit JSON mode

**Updated:**
- System message + user message format for OpenAI
- `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` enforced
- User message includes JSON.dumps() for proper formatting

**Example:**
```python
# Original (Claude)
prompt = f"Analyze this... {signals}"

# Updated (OpenAI)
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze: {json.dumps(signals)}"}
]
response_format = {"type": "json_object"}
```

## Risk Management Additions

**New risks identified and mitigated:**

1. **Reverse Image Search Reliability**
   - Risk: Free scraping may fail due to rate limits
   - Mitigation: Graceful degradation, continue with other signals
   - Documentation: Clearly stated limitation in UI

2. **EXIF Data Availability**
   - Risk: Social media platforms strip EXIF metadata
   - Mitigation: LLM acknowledges this in analysis
   - Documentation: Known limitation in README

3. **API Response Validation**
   - Risk: OpenAI may return invalid JSON (rare with json_object mode)
   - Mitigation: JSON parsing error handling + validation
   - Fallback: Generic response with confidence: 50

---

## Known Limitations (Enhanced Documentation)

The original spec listed 8 limitations. Updated to 10 with more detail:

1. C2PA mocked (was: "may return not found")
2. Reverse search free tier (was: "TinEye limited")
3. **NEW:** Graceful degradation when search fails
4. **NEW:** Social media EXIF stripping caveat
5. Video not supported (unchanged)
6. No storage (unchanged)
7. No authentication (unchanged)
8. No CMS integration (unchanged)
9. Rights tracking mockup (unchanged)
10. License templates not legal (unchanged)

---

## Testing Enhancements

**Added test cases:**
- Test with images WITHOUT EXIF (screenshots)
- Test with images from Twitter/Instagram (EXIF stripped)
- Test error handling when reverse search fails
- Test OpenAI JSON parsing validation

---

## Future Production Roadmap

**Phase 2 Enhancements (unchanged priority):**
1. ✅ Implement production C2PA checking with c2pa-python
2. ✅ Evaluate reverse search: paid TinEye vs free alternatives
3. Add video support
4. Add persistent storage (PostgreSQL)
5. Add user authentication
6. Build CMS integration
7. Add batch processing
8. Metrics dashboard

**Phase 2 Decision Points (new):**
1. Reverse search: Evaluate reliability of free options in production
   - If unreliable: Budget for TinEye API
   - If acceptable: Continue with SerpAPI or custom scraper
2. OpenAI costs: Monitor API usage
   - If costs high: Consider GPT-4o-mini alternatives
   - If acceptable: Consider upgrading to GPT-4o for better quality

---

## Success Criteria (Unchanged)

All original success criteria remain valid:
- ✅ 60-second analysis time
- ✅ WCAG AA compliance
- ✅ Mobile responsive
- ✅ Deployed to Replit
- ✅ Clean, documented code

---

## Summary

**Total Changes:** 6 major, 4 minor
**Breaking Changes:** None (architecture unchanged)
**Timeline Impact:** None (changes simplified implementation)
**Quality Impact:** Minimal (alternative approaches equally valid)

All changes were made to:
1. Work within available resources (API keys, budget)
2. Maintain 48-hour timeline feasibility
3. Demonstrate equivalent technical competence
4. Provide realistic prototype for interview demonstration

**The core product vision and user experience remain identical to the original specification.**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** Phase 1 (Pre-implementation)
**Status:** All planning documents synchronized
